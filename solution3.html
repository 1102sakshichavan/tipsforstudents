    <ul>
        <li> Regular Movement Breaks: Every hour or so, take a short break to move around. This could be as simple as standing up, stretching your arms and legs, or doing a quick walk around your study area. Physical movement helps increase blood flow to your brain, keeping you more alert and energized.</li><br/>
        <li>Exercise Sessions: Incorporate regular exercise into your daily routine. Even just 20-30 minutes of moderate exercise, such as brisk walking, jogging, or cycling, can significantly improve your energy levels and cognitive function. Schedule your workouts at times when you tend to feel the most sluggish, such as in the morning or after lunch. </li><br/>
        <li>Active Study Methods: Combine physical activity with your study sessions. For example, you could listen to recorded lectures while going for a walk or use a standing desk to review your notes while standing. These active study methods not only keep your body moving but also help reinforce your learning by engaging multiple senses.
        </li><br/>
        <li>Desk Exercises: If you're unable to leave your study area, incorporate desk exercises into your routine. Simple movements like shoulder rolls, neck stretches, or leg lifts can help alleviate tension and boost your alertness without disrupting your study flow.

        <li>Stay Hydrated: Drinking water throughout the day not only keeps you hydrated but also encourages regular bathroom breaks, providing opportunities to move around and stretch your legs.</li><br/>
