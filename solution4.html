    <h3>Here are some tips to help you stay hydrated while studying:

    </h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Keep a Water Bottle Nearby: Having a water bottle within arm's reach makes it easy to sip on water throughout your study session.
        </li><br/>
        <li>Set Reminders: If you tend to forget to drink water, set reminders on your phone or use an app to prompt you to take a drink every hour.

        </li><br/>
        <li>Drink Before You're Thirsty: Thirst is a sign that you're already somewhat dehydrated, so don't wait until you feel thirsty to drink water. Make it a habit to take regular sips throughout the day.
        </li><br/>
        <li>Monitor Your Urine Color: One simple way to gauge your hydration status is by checking the color of your urine. Pale yellow or straw-colored urine generally indicates that you're well-hydrated, while darker urine may be a sign that you need to drink more water.</li>
