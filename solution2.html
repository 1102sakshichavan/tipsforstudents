    <h1>SOLUTION :</h1>
    <ul>
        <li> Divide and conquer: Instead of attempting to study for several hours straight, break your study sessions into shorter, more manageable chunks. Aim for study periods of around 25-45 minutes, known as the Pomodoro Technique, followed by a short break.</li><br/>
        <li>Utilize breaks effectively: During your breaks, step away from your study space and engage in activities that provide mental refreshment. Stretch, take a short walk, grab a healthy snack, or simply close your eyes and relax for a few minutes. These breaks help prevent burnout and maintain your overall energy levels. </li><br/>
        <li>Mix up your subjects: If you have multiple subjects to study, consider alternating between them during your study sessions. This variety keeps your brain engaged and prevents monotony, reducing the likelihood of feeling sleepy.</li><br/>
        <li>Stay disciplined: It's important to stick to your designated study and break times to maximize productivity. Avoid the temptation to extend your study sessions beyond their allotted time, as this can lead to mental fatigue and decreased efficiency.

        </li><br/>
        <li>Adjust based on personal preference: Experiment with different study session lengths and break intervals to find what works best for you. Some individuals may thrive with shorter, more frequent breaks, while others may prefer longer study periods with fewer breaks.</li><br/>
