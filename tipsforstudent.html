    <ol>
        <li>
            <h2>Get Enough Sleep</h2>
            <p>
                <h3>Reasons</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>When you're sleep-deprived, your body and brain naturally crave rest. Sleep plays a crucial role in cognitive function, memory consolidation, and overall well-being.</li>
                    <li>Without adequate sleep, your ability to focus, concentrate, and retain information diminishes. This makes it much harder to stay awake and alert during study sessions.

            <h2>Break up study sessions</h2>
            <h3>Reasons :</h3>
            
            <ul>
                <li>Long study sessions can lead to diminishing returns as your attention span wanes over time. </li>
                <li>Your brain's ability to maintain focus gradually declines, making it easier to become bored and ultimately feel sleepy.</li>
            </ul><br/>

        <li>
            <h2>Stay Active</h2>
            <h3>Reasons :</h3>
            
            <ul>
                <li>When you're physically inactive for extended periods, your body's metabolism slows down, and your brain receives fewer oxygen and nutrients.  </li>
                <li>This can lead to feelings of drowsiness and lethargy, making it harder to stay awake and focused while studying.</li>
            </ul><br/>

            <li>
                <h2>Stay Hydrated.</h2>
                <h3>Reasons :</h3>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>Dehydration can have a significant impact on your energy levels and cognitive function.  </li>
                    <li>When you're dehydrated, your body and brain don't function as efficiently, leading to feelings of fatigue and difficulty concentrating.</li>
                </ul><br/>

        <li>
            <h2>Avoid Heavy Meals.</h2>
            <h3>Reasons :</h3>
            
            <ul>
                <li>Heavy meals can cause a spike in blood sugar levels followed by a crash, resulting in a feeling of lethargy.</li>
                <li> Foods high in refined carbohydrates, such as white bread, pasta, and sugary snacks, can contribute to this cycle by rapidly raising blood sugar levels and then causing them to plummet shortly afterward. </li>
            </ul><br/>
